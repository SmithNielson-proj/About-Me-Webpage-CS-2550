    <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>

    <p>The first personal intrest I want to talk about is my love for hiking. I have grown up in Utah and have been around
    these mountains my whole life. Every summer I look forward to picking new mountains around me that I haven't hiked and
    train to hike them. My most recent hike was to the summit of Mt. Nebo. I am hoping this year to tackle Kings Peak.</p>

    <p>The next one I want to talk about is my intrest in Video Games. Ever since I was a kid I have played Video Games.
    My current games I am playing are Valheim, Graveyard Keeper and Leaugue of Legends. I like a variety of games and the
    ones I like the most are strategy or competative games. </p>

    <p>The final intrest I will discuss here is sports. I like watching professional and college level sports, mostly football
    and basketball. My favorite NFL teams are the Saints and the Ravens. I also am a big Jazz fan, but also enjoy watching
    any teams play. I have grown up around sports and they have always been a big part of my life. </p>
